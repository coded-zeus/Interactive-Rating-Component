### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I learned

```css
I learnt that to create the active button effect, instead of using Js. You can use the :focus, but the buttons will have to be nested in another elements.
```
```js
I used the arrow function for the first time and i'm glad it worked in the first try. I don't know why formatting the document messes it up though.
```
### Continued development
- I just need to practice more javascript to know more. 

### Useful resources
w3schools really helped me.
